                    <h2 className="py-4 text-lg font-bold">Data Destruction</h2>
                    Data destruction ensures that TypingChild.com manages the data it controls and processes it in an
                    efficient and responsible manner. When the retention period for the data as outlined above expires,
                    TypingChild.com will actively destroy the data covered by this policy. If an individual believes
                    that there exists a legitimate business reason why certain data should not be destroyed at the end
                    of a retention period, he or she should identify this data to his/her supervisor and provide
                    information as to why the data should not be destroyed. Any exceptions to this data retention
                    policy must be approved by TypingChild.com’s data protection offer in consultation with legal
                    counsel. In rare circumstances, a litigation hold may be issued by legal counsel prohibiting the
                    destruction of certain documents. A litigation hold remains in effect until released by legal
                    counsel and prohibits the destruction of data subject to the hold.

            <h1>DATA RETENTION POLICY</h1>
            <div>
                TypingChild.com seeks to ensure that it retains only data necessary to effectively conduct its
                program activities and work in fulfilment of its mission.
                The need to retain data varies widely with the type of data and the purpose for which it was
                collected. TypingChild.com strives to ensure that data is only retained for the period necessary to
                fulfil the purpose for which it was collected and is fully deleted when no longer required. This
                policy sets forth TypingChild.com’s guidelines on data retention and is to be consistently applied
                throughout the organization.
                Scope
                This policy covers all data collected by TypingChild.com and stored on TypingChild.com owned or
                leased systems and media, regardless of location. It applies to both data collected and held
                electronically (including photographs, video and audio recordings) and data that is collected and
                held as hard copy or paper files. The need to retain certain information may be mandated by federal

                Protection Regulation (GDPR).

                Data Duplication

                Data Destruction
                Data destruction ensures that TypingChild.com manages the data it controls and processes it in an
                efficient and responsible manner. When the retention period for the data as outlined above expires,
                TypingChild.com will actively destroy the data covered by this policy. If an individual believes
                that there exists a legitimate business reason why certain data should not be destroyed at the end
                of a retention period, he or she should identify this data to his/her supervisor and provide
                information as to why the data should not be destroyed. Any exceptions to this data retention
                policy must be approved by TypingChild.com’s data protection offer in consultation with legal
                counsel. In rare circumstances, a litigation hold may be issued by legal counsel prohibiting the
                destruction of certain documents. A litigation hold remains in effect until released by legal
                counsel and prohibits the destruction of data subject to the hold.
